# My Emacs configuration folder
## Overview
Instead of maintaining my emacs configuration in my .emacs file, I have my emacs configuration in [emacs-config.org](https://github.com/sreegowthamj/emacs-config/blob/master/emacs-config.org) file which is converted to emacs-config.el code at every startup. At startup, my .emacs file loads this emacs-config.el file to load my personal configuration. I program mostly in C++, python and Tex and my configuration reflects the same.

The basic idea of this configuration has been explained by [Karl Voit](https://github.com/novoid) over [here](https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs#general-structure) and [here](http://karl-voit.at/2017/06/03/emacs-org/).
